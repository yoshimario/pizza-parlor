_This project I really wanted to make the user experience shine thru. I had a vision of having a video in the background and having a container over top of that. I then on top of that proceeded to have a jumbotron with another video in the background of a fire pit. I also then had a animated gradient effect to the selection of pizza size and toppings. I continued the gradient effect when user submits the order as well._
